<p>Coding and complexities are my absolute passions and there is nothing that I am not curious about. I will try to solve everything no matter what. Also, I have an excellent taste for jokes!</p>

<p>I never wanted to code until I learnt it is like building a house and I was fed up with politics in my business job all the time. Now, I train deep neural networks to become better at translation.</p>
