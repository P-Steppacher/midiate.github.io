# Who are we?

We are a team of three with backgrounds in Math, Business, and Information Technology. Our favourite languages are Python and JavaScript.

Hi, I am Albert and I studied math. I want to get an app into the Playstore.

Coding and complexities are my absolute passions and there is nothing that I am not curious about. I will try to solve everything no matter what. Also, I have an excellent taste for jokes!

I never wanted to code until I learnt it is like building a house and I was fed up with politics in my business job all the time. Now, I train deep neural networks to become better at translation.
